# CS4400-Intro-to-Database-Systems-

#The goal of this project was to design and implement a movie theater website where online users could create a profile, buy movie tickets, give reviews of movies, and look up movie ratings. The website designed is fully functional and even includes an option for a manager of the theater to sign in as an administrator and is given access to the back-end information. 

#This website was designed by creating a database in MySQL and embedding SQL queries in php script in the website. Bootstrap was helpful in designing a basic layout for the website in a speedy fashion. 

#The designs of the website and Database system are provided in submissions.pdf
